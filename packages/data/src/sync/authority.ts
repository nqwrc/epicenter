/**
 * The authority: an append-only log of opaque bytes, and no Yjs call at all.
 *
 * There are no Yjs imports in this file, and that is the design rather than an
 * accident of the current implementation. It never merges, never compacts,
 * never holds a document, never decodes, and never learns what a row is.
 * Catch-up is "everything after your cursor" and a live relay is the same
 * sentence with a cursor one behind the head, so there is one delivery path
 * rather than two that can disagree.
 *
 * ## Why it does not look at the bytes
 *
 * An earlier version made exactly one Yjs call before storing, `diffUpdateV2`
 * against an empty state vector, and kept only whether it threw. It was removed.
 * The reasons are written down here because "surely the server should check the
 * update is valid" is the obvious thing to propose, and every part of the bill
 * is invisible from the call site:
 *
 * - **It could not be a proof, only a filter.** Whether bytes throw depends on
 *   the structs the RECEIVER already holds, and the authority holds none by
 *   construction, so the receiver's predicate is not available to it at any
 *   price. Swept over every single-byte corruption of a real update, the call
 *   let through 44 poison pills on a full update and 4 on an increment;
 *   integrating into a throwaway `Y.Doc`, the most an authority could possibly
 *   do, still leaked 3 (`evidence/validation.test.ts`).
 * - **It was the most expensive thing here.** 283 MB rss and 45 ms on a 27.7 MB
 *   update, which is MORE than hydrating an entire `Y.Doc` (108 MB, 35 ms),
 *   because it decodes the whole stream and re-encodes a full copy before
 *   discarding it. The cheap-looking call was the ceiling on what one submission
 *   costs the object, and it is the measurement that removed it
 *   (`evidence/bench/validate.ts`).
 * - **It was the only thing coupling this file to Yjs's version.** With it gone,
 *   a Yjs format change cannot make the server refuse a valid client's writes.
 * - **It foreclosed end-to-end encryption**, which is possible exactly as long
 *   as the authority never reads the bytes. That is the reason not to reach for
 *   it again the next time it looks free.
 *
 * Recovery never needed it either. The log is append-only and every entry is
 * individually addressable, so a poison entry is repaired by overwriting that
 * one row's bytes with the 13-byte empty update, a valid no-op that keeps the
 * sequence contiguous and that every replica walks straight past. A replica that
 * cannot apply an entry says so and names the position
 * (`SyncClientError.Unapplyable`); both halves are pinned in
 * `sync/transport.test.ts`. What bounds the damage in the first place is that a
 * partition has one writer principal, so the only party who can author bytes
 * that brick it is the party that owns it.
 *
 * ## Why it refuses root-document compaction
 *
 * Four authority designs were built and withdrawn, all failing at one joint: a
 * A root-document rewrite must prove the replacement covers what it replaces,
 * and that proof needs semantics the authority was defined not to have. The
 * authority therefore does not own that product action. It does perform the
 * narrower automatic snapshot fold: a client offers its own state, and the
 * authority verifies only that the connection was sent through the offered
 * position. The application merge remains on the client, over bytes that
 * client owns.
 *
 * Do not reintroduce root-document compaction or baselines here. Snapshot
 * coverage is the separate automatic log-folding invariant.
 *
 * A document identity is metadata for sync admission. This authority names
 * the current identity but does not expose a destructive whole-document
 * replacement operation; any future Compact workspace feature must own that
 * product decision explicitly.
