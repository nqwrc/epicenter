 * What the transport does inside `workerd`, measured rather than assumed.

 * Run against a live worker:
 *
 *   bun --cwd apps/sync-lab wrangler dev        # a terminal of its own
 *   bun run packages/data/evidence/workerd/probe.ts http://127.0.0.1:8787
 *
 * and against a deployment by passing its origin instead. Nothing here runs in
 * `bun test`, because the thing being measured is the runtime.
 *
 * ## Method
 *
 * Every experiment carries a CONTROL THAT MUST FAIL if the test is not live,
 * and the control is reported beside the result. Three experiments on this
 * branch passed for hollow reasons before anyone noticed: a forged baseline
 * that was rejected for the wrong reason, a cursor rule that "worked" in a
 * simulation where nothing was ever delivered, and a memory table measured with
 * six shapes in one process so the allocator's high-water mark landed on the
 * first. Each was caught because a number looked odd, not because an assertion
 * failed.
