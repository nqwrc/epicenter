/**
 * Whispering's inert data definition.
 *
 * Pure JSON: closed field descriptors and nothing that knows about
 * storage, sync or documents (ADR-0213). Runtimes own all of that.
 *
 * Three things about this file are decisions rather than transcription of the
 * old contract, and each is load-bearing.
 *
 * **Settings live in `kv`, not in a table.** They used to be one row at the
 * chosen id `'settings'`. A chosen row id is a nested container addressed by
 * the operation that created it, so two devices both writing settings on their
 * own boot path create two containers and map LWW discards one along with every
 * value in it. KV lives at a name-addressed root, where independent minting
 * converges (ADR-0216).
 *
 * **Transcripts stay in the row.** They are machine-produced, replaced
 * wholesale, and rendered in the recordings list, so nothing about them wants
 * per-character merging. That is the opposite of Honeycrisp's call for prose
 * (ADR-0207) and it is deliberate: a note is written by a person a character at
 * a time, a transcript arrives finished.
 *
 * **There are no optional fields.** A field has to be one type through the CRDT
 * attribute, the projection column and the row alike, and "absent" is not a SQL
 * type. What would have been optional is nullable with a `= null` default,
 * which a read applies and a write never stores.
