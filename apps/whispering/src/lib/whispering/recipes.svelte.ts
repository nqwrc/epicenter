/**
 * Recipes, read straight out of the document.
 *
 * A user recipe's identity IS its minted row id, and the built-in ones ship in
 * code under a `builtin:` prefix and are not rows at all (`workspace/index.ts`,
 * ADR-0099, ADR-0206). So the `sourceId` column and the two-way id map that
 * used to live here are both gone.
 *
 * This is a `.svelte.ts` module because the state IS reactive state, and runes
 * own that. It previously held four `let`s, a `Set` of listeners, a `notify`
 * fanout and a `subscribe` method, which together reimplemented `$state` by
 * hand; and `pickable` was recomputed inside the read, which is what `$derived`
 * is for. It also held a generation counter, an `isDisposed` flag and a retry
 * loop, all of which arbitrated between asynchronous reads that could land out
 * of order. Reads are synchronous now (ADR-0215), so none of that can happen.
