/**
 * THROWAWAY, and test-only: a peer that lives inside `workerd`.
 *
 * It is a Durable Object only because a Store needs synchronous SQLite and this
 * is the only such SQLite `workerd` supplies. This is NOT the browser storage
 * topology: a browser keeps its durable client facts in IndexedDB. The peer
 * keeps them in its one DO SQLite database through the engine seam
 * (`@epicenter/data/engine`), so this Worker-runtime test can run the real
 * `createAccountStore`, `createSyncClient`, and WebSocket protocol against
 * the real authority.
 *
 * Therefore this fixture proves authority hibernation and protocol convergence,
 * not browser persistence. Browser storage behavior belongs in `packages/data`
 * browser tests.
 *
 * It is deliberately NOT exported from `worker/index.ts` and NOT in
 * `wrangler.jsonc`. Only `worker/test-entry.ts` mounts it, so nothing that
 * deploys grows a class that exists for a test.
